plats-api
=========

taobao paipai jingdong plat api
taobao.php is the application file
t.php is the function file
config.php is the config file

it's used to connect to taobao,paipai and jingdong open plat to get data or change something.
I put the SDK packages to one place and to use it in one input which is the taobao.php
